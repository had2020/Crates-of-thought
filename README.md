# 🦀 My Rust Challenge Vault

Welcome to my Rust practice challenge vault!
As part of my ongoing effort to improve my Rust proficiency, I have worked through these problems. Each solution includes a README so you can learn by trying them out.
These are handcrafted exercises I've completed to sharpen my Rust skills: ranging from basic ownership patterns to advanced traits, generics, and systems-level thinking.

Each subdirectory is a fully runnable binary crate. You can run any challenge solution using:

```bash
cargo run -p <crate_name>
```

Each cargo project has a readme with the challenge!

# Current challenges
- Basic_Command_Processor (Key: Enum)
- Count Character Frequencies using HashMap (Key: HashMap)

# 🚧 More to Come
I'am actively working on new challenges like:
- Traits & Generics
- Custom Iterators
- Lifetime challenges
- ML-flavored design problems (I'm building a Keras framework with Keras like impl in Rust 🧠⚙️)
